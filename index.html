            Humans are powerful and beautiful...but they have to see it first, and see the power and beauty both within themselves and outside. Eyesight and vision are not the same. Eyesight perceives the surface of what is. Vision perceives what's beneath and above, and merges with your own creativity to produce your own perception, your own reality, your own world. - Erwan Le Corre
